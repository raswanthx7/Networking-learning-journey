##  What is a NIC?

A **NIC (Network Interface Card)** is a hardware component that allows a computer or device to connect to a network.

Each computer (or laptop) must have a NIC to send and receive data across networks—either **wired** (Ethernet) or **wireless** (Wi-Fi).

##  Why do we use a NIC?

Without a NIC, a device cannot communicate with other devices or access the internet. It plays a **bridge role** between the computer and the network.

There are two types:
-  **Wired NIC** – Uses **RJ45** cable (Ethernet) to connect to LAN, switches, routers.
-  **Wireless NIC** – Built-in chip used to connect to **Wi-Fi** networks.

##  Real-World Example

Let’s say we have 4 computers in an office:

1. Each computer has a **NIC** (Ethernet port).
2. We use an **RJ45 cable** to connect each computer's NIC to a **network switch**.
3. The **switch** is connected to a **router**.
4. The **router** is connected to the **internet**.
5. All computers share the internet and local data via the switch.
