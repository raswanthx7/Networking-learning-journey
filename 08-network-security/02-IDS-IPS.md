#  IDS & IPS Concepts

##  Topics Covered
- What is IDS (Intrusion Detection System)?  
- What is IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)?  
- IDS vs IPS (Comparison Table)  
- Why IPS is needed if Firewall/WAF already exist?  
- Real-world Examples & Startup Scenario

## 1. IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
- **Definition:** A security system that monitors network traffic and looks for suspicious or malicious activity.  
- **Action:** It only **detects and alerts**, does not block traffic.  
- **Placement:** Out-of-band (like a sensor, connected to a copy of traffic).  

**Analogy:**  
Like a **CCTV camera** in your office → it records and alerts when something suspicious happens, but it cannot stop the intruder.  

**Examples:**  
- Snort IDS (open source)  
- OSSEC HIDS (Host-based IDS)  
- AWS GuardDuty (cloud IDS service)

## 2. IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
- **Definition:** A security system that monitors network traffic and **actively blocks malicious packets in real time**.  
- **Action:** Detects **and prevents** attacks.  
- **Placement:** Inline with the network (sits between firewall and servers).  

**Analogy:**  
Like a **security guard with a taser** → not only sees the intruder but also stops him at the gate.  

**Examples:**  
- Cisco Firepower IPS  
- Suricata IPS  
- AWS Network Firewall (IPS features)

## 3. IDS vs IPS

| Feature   | IDS (Detection)             | IPS (Prevention)          |
|-----------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Action    | Monitors, logs, alerts only | Blocks, drops, prevents    |
| Placement | Out-of-band (passive)       | Inline (active in traffic) |
| Analogy   | CCTV camera                 | Security guard             |
| Example   | Snort IDS, AWS GuardDuty    | Cisco IPS, Suricata IPS    |

## 4. Why IPS if Firewall/WAF Already Exist?

###  Firewall
- Checks **IP, port, protocol**.  
- Too basic → cannot detect advanced attacks hidden in normal traffic.  

###  WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- Protects only **web apps** (Layer 7: HTTP/HTTPS).  
- Blocks SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.  
- But it does **not** monitor other protocols (FTP, DNS, SSH, etc.).  

###  IPS
- Inspects **all types of traffic** (not just web apps).  
- Stops malware, worms, trojans, port scans, DDoS attempts.  
- Provides **network-wide protection**, not limited to web servers.  

**Startup Example:**  
- Your firewall blocks unknown IPs.  
- Your WAF blocks SQL Injection on your website.  
- But a hacker tries to spread malware over SSH into your internal server →  
  - Firewall allows SSH (since you need it).  
  - WAF doesn’t care (not a web app).  
  - **IPS blocks it immediately.**  

 This is why IPS is needed **in addition** to Firewall and WAF → together they form **Defense in Depth**.

##  Final Summary
- **IDS = Detection only (CCTV, Alarm).**  
- **IPS = Detection + Prevention (Active Guard).**  
- **Firewall** = Basic gatekeeper (IP/port/protocol).  
- **WAF** = Specialized bodyguard for web apps only.  
- **IPS** = Network-wide security guard for all protocols, stops advanced attacks.
