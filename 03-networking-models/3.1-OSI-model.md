##  Overview
The **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)** is a conceptual framework that standardizes how different computer systems communicate over a network. It breaks down the communication process into seven layers, each with its own functions. 
It helps understand how data moves across a network and how different protocols and devices interact.

##  7 Layers of the OSI Model

| Layer Number | Layer Name            | PDU (Protocol Data Unit) | Purpose | Example Protocols / Devices |
|--------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------|-----------------------------|
| 7            | Application Layer     | Data                     | User interface & app services | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP |
| 6            | Presentation Layer    | Data                     | Data format translation, encryption, compression | JPEG, PNG, SSL/TLS |
| 5            | Session Layer         | Data                     | Session management & synchronization | NetBIOS, PPTP |
| 4            | Transport Layer       | Segment                  | Reliable/unreliable data delivery | TCP, UDP |
| 3            | Network Layer         | Packet                   | Logical addressing & routing | IP, ICMP, OSPF |
| 2            | Data Link Layer       | Frame                    | Physical addressing & error detection | Ethernet, MAC addresses |
| 1            | Physical Layer        | Bits                     | Transmission of raw bits over a medium | Cables, Hubs, Fiber |

## Common Protocols in Application Layer

| Protocol   | Full Form                                           | Purpose                                           | Example Usage                           |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **HTTP**   | HyperText Transfer Protocol                          | Transfers web pages (text, images, etc.) over the internet | Browsing a website                       |
| **HTTPS**  | HTTP Secure                                          | Same as HTTP but with encryption (TLS/SSL)        | Online banking, secure shopping          |
| **FTP**    | File Transfer Protocol                               | Transfers files between computers                 | Uploading files to a web server           |
| **SMTP**   | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol                        | Sends emails from client to mail server           | Sending an email via Outlook              |
| **IMAP / POP3** | Internet Message Access Protocol / Post Office Protocol | Retrieves emails from server                      | Reading email in Gmail via app            |
| **DNS**    | Domain Name System                                   | Resolves domain names to IP addresses             | Typing `google.com` and getting its IP    |

## Example – Web Browser Using Application Services

Let’s say you open your browser and type:

```text
https://www.example.com
```

1. **DNS** resolves `www.example.com` to an IP (e.g., `93.184.216.34`).
2. **HTTPS** establishes a secure connection (handshake, encryption).
3. **HTTP** sends a request: `GET /index.html`.
4. The web server sends back the HTML, CSS, and JS files.
5. The **UI** in the browser displays the page for you.

##  Encapsulation Process
Encapsulation is the process of **wrapping data** with the necessary protocol information before network transmission.

1. **Application Layer** – Generates user data.
2. **Transport Layer** – Adds TCP/UDP headers (creates segments).
3. **Network Layer** – Adds IP header (creates packets).
4. **Data Link Layer** – Adds MAC addresses & error-checking info (creates frames).
5. **Physical Layer** – Converts frames into bits for transmission.

##  PDU (Protocol Data Unit) at Each Layer
- Application: **Data**
- Transport: **Segment** (TCP) or **Datagram** (UDP)
- Network: **Packet**
- Data Link: **Frame**
- Physical: **Bits**

---

##  Key Terms Learned Today
- **Encapsulation** – Wrapping data with protocol-specific information at each layer.
- **TCP Header** – Contains source/destination ports, sequence numbers, and control flags.
- **UDP Header** – Contains source/destination ports and length, simpler than TCP.
- **Packets** – Network Layer data units containing headers and payload.
- **Frames** – Data Link Layer units containing MAC addressing and error detection.

##  Real-World Example (Cloud & AWS Context)
- When you upload a file to **AWS S3**:
  1. Data starts at the **Application Layer** (HTTPS request).
  2. Encapsulated into **TCP segments**.
  3. Routed over the internet as **IP packets**.
  4. Sent as **Ethernet frames** across physical devices until reaching AWS servers.
- Knowing this helps in **troubleshooting connectivity, latency, and packet loss** in cloud environments.
