## 1. Introduction to TCP/IP Model
- **Definition:** TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) is both a conceptual framework and a set of real protocols used for communication across networks.
- **History:** Developed in the 1970s by the U.S. Department of Defense for ARPANET.
- **Importance:** Foundation of the modern Internet, used in all network communications.

## 2. Layers of TCP/IP Model
TCP/IP has **4 layers**:
1. Application Layer
2. Transport Layer
3. Internet Layer
4. Network Access Layer

---

## 3. Application Layer (Detailed)
- **Purpose:** Provides network services directly to the user or applications.
- **Responsibilities:** Defines data formatting, presentation, and exchange.
- **Examples:** HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS, SMTP.
- **Real-world analogy:** Language and format of a letter.

---

## 4. Transport Layer (Detailed)
- **Purpose:** Manages end-to-end communication, reliability, and sequencing.
- **Main Protocols:**
  - **TCP:** Reliable, connection-oriented (e.g., web browsing, downloads).
  - **UDP:** Unreliable, connectionless (e.g., streaming, gaming).
- **Responsibilities:** Segmentation, sequencing, error detection, flow control.
- **Analogy:** TCP is like a tracked courier; UDP is like sending postcards.

---

## 5. Internet Layer (Detailed)
- **Purpose:** Handles logical addressing, routing, and packet delivery.
- **Protocols:** IPv4, IPv6, ICMP, ARP.
- **Responsibilities:** IP addressing, routing, fragmentation.
- **Analogy:** Postal address system.

---

## 6. Network Access Layer (Detailed)
- **Purpose:** Manages the physical transmission of data between devices.
- **Covers:** OSI's Physical Layer + Data Link Layer.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Physical transmission (signals, cables, Wi-Fi).
  - MAC addressing (unique hardware ID).
  - Framing (Ethernet frames, headers, CRC).
  - Link-level error detection.
  - Media access control (deciding who can send data).
- **Analogy:** Roads and vehicles delivering goods.

## 7. TCP/IP vs OSI Model
| TCP/IP Layer        | OSI Equivalent Layers             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Application         | Application, Presentation, Session|
| Transport           | Transport                         |
| Internet            | Network                           |
| Network Access      | Data Link + Physical              |

## 8. Why TCP/IP is Used Instead of OSI
- OSI is **theoretical**; TCP/IP is **practical and implemented**.
- TCP/IP was adopted earlier; OSI came too late.
- TCP/IP is scalable, robust, and widely supported.

---

## 9. Mapping Between TCP/IP and OSI Layers
- TCP/IP's Network Access Layer = OSI's Physical + Data Link.
- TCP/IP's Application Layer = OSI's Application + Presentation + Session.

---

## 10. Network Access Layer Responsibilities
- Assigning and using **MAC addresses**.
- Managing **physical devices** (cables, switches, routers, Wi-Fi).
- Converting data into physical signals.
- Packaging data into frames with MAC addresses and error-checking bits.

---

## 11. Why Presentation and Session Layers Are Not in TCP/IP
- **Presentation Layer in OSI:**  
  - Handles data formatting, encryption, and compression.  
  - In TCP/IP, these are handled **inside the Application Layer protocols** (e.g., HTTPS handles encryption, web servers handle formatting).
- **Session Layer in OSI:**  
  - Manages communication sessions, synchronisation, and checkpoints.  
  - In TCP/IP, these tasks are done by **Transport Layer (TCP)** and Application protocols (e.g., HTTP, SSH).
- **Reason for Omission:**  
  - TCP/IP was designed for **practicality** and combined these functions into other layers.
  - Many of these responsibilities depend on the specific application, so they are not separate in TCP/IP.

---

##  Summary
Today I learned:
- The **TCP/IP model** is a 4-layer practical networking model used globally.
- Each layer has specific roles and protocols.
- TCP/IP is preferred over OSI for real-world use.
- The Network Access Layer handles both physical transmission and MAC addressing.
- TCP/IP and OSI are related but not identical â€” OSI is more for theory, TCP/IP for real-world implementation.
- Presentation and Session layers are merged into other layers in TCP/IP for simplicity and efficiency.
