##  What is a Switch?

A **Switch** is a networking device used to connect multiple devices (like computers, printers, servers) within a **Local Area Network (LAN)**. It operates at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)** of the OSI model.

The switch reads the **MAC address** of each connected device and sends data **only to the specific device** it is intended for — not to all devices.

---

### Why Do We Use a Switch?

- To **connect multiple devices** in a LAN efficiently.
- To **reduce unnecessary traffic** on the network.
- To provide **faster communication** between devices.
- It **learns MAC addresses** and creates a MAC address table for efficient data delivery.

---

###  Real-World Example of Switch Usage:

In a company with 10 computers:
- Each computer's **NIC port** is connected to a switch using **RJ45 cables**.
- The switch is then connected to a **router**.
- The router connects to the **internet**.
- The switch manages internal communication (file sharing, printing) between the computers.

##  What is a Hub?

A **Hub** is a basic networking device used to connect multiple devices in a LAN. It also operates at **Layer 1 (Physical Layer)** of the OSI model.

Unlike a switch, a hub **doesn't filter or direct data**. When it receives data, it **broadcasts it to all ports**, regardless of the destination.

---

###  Why Do We Use a Hub?

- Used in **very small networks** or for **simple tasks**.
- Cheaper and easier to set up than a switch.
- Mainly used in **legacy systems** or as a quick troubleshooting tool.

---

###  Real-World Example of Hub Usage:

In a basic test lab or small home setup:
- A hub can be used to **connect 2–4 devices** temporarily.
- It sends any data received from one device to **all other connected devices**.
- This can lead to **network collisions** and **inefficient traffic**.

##  Switch vs Hub – Quick Comparison

| Feature           | Switch                          | Hub                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| OSI Layer        | Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)        | Layer 1 (Physical Layer)       |
| Data Handling    | Sends data to **specific device**| Broadcasts to **all devices**  |
| Performance      | High (less traffic, fewer errors)| Low (more traffic, collisions) |
| Cost             | More expensive                   | Cheaper                        |
| MAC Address Table| Yes                              | No                             |

>  **Conclusion**:  
> Switches are smarter, faster, and widely used in modern networks. Hubs are outdated and used only in special cases.
