##  Definition
VTP Pruning reduces unnecessary VLAN traffic by ensuring that broadcast, multicast, and unknown unicast traffic is sent **only to switches that need it**.

---

##  Key Concepts
- By default, VTP floods all VLAN traffic to all trunk links.  
- Pruning prevents flooding VLAN traffic to switches that **do not have active ports** in that VLAN.  
- Enabled on the **VTP Server**, and applied across the VTP domain.

##  Example Story
Company has 3 switches:

- **SW1**: VLAN 10 (Developers), VLAN 20 (HR)  
- **SW2**: VLAN 10 (Developers only)  
- **SW3**: VLAN 20 (HR only)  

ðŸ”¹ **Without VTP Pruning**  
- A broadcast from VLAN 10 on SW1 goes to SW2  and SW3  (unnecessary).  

ðŸ”¹ **With VTP Pruning**  
- SW1 sends VLAN 10 traffic only to SW2 (since SW3 doesnâ€™t have VLAN 10).  
- Bandwidth saved, less flooding .

## Real-world Usage
- **Enterprise LANs**: Saves bandwidth in large VLAN networks.  
- **Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)**: No direct VTP pruning, but the same idea exists with **VPCs, subnets, and routing/security rules**.
