## 1. What is DHCP?
- **Full Form:** Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  
- **Purpose:**  A network service that automatically gives IP addresses and other network details to devices (computers, mobiles, printers) when they join a network.
- Eliminates the need for manual IP configuration.

## 2. Why Do We Need DHCP?

Imagine an office with **500 laptops**:  
- If the admin manually assigns IPs, mistakes will happen (duplicate IPs, wrong subnet, wrong gateway).  
- With DHCP, the DHCP server automatically manages IPs → no confusion, no duplicates, less manual work.

## 3. The Key Information DHCP Provides

When a device connects, DHCP usually gives:  
- **IP Address** → Unique address for the device.  
- **Subnet Mask** → To know its network range.  
- **Default Gateway** → The router IP to reach outside networks.  
- **DNS Servers** → To resolve domain names (google.com → IP).  
- *(Optional: Lease Time, NTP server, etc.)*

## 4. How DHCP Works (The DORA Process)

When you connect to Wi-Fi or plug into LAN, your device talks to the DHCP server using **4 steps called DORA**:  

1. **Discover** – Device says: Hey, I need an IP! Is there any DHCP server out there? (broadcast request)  
2. **Offer** – DHCP server replies: Yes! I can offer you IP 192.168.1.50.  
3. **Request** – Device responds: Okay, I accept 192.168.1.50. Please assign it to me.  
4. **Acknowledge** – DHCP server confirms: Done, 192.168.1.50 is now yours for the next 24 hours.  

 This is called the **DHCP lease** (temporary ownership of IP).

## 5. Lease Time
- **Definition:** The **time period** for which the DHCP server assigns an IP to a device.  
- After lease expires, the device must **renew** the IP or request a new one.  

### Scenario Example
- DHCP server lease time = 24 hours  
- Laptop gets IP `192.168.1.20` at 10:00 AM  
- At 10:00 AM next day:  
  - If laptop is still connected → automatically renews the lease  
  - If laptop disconnected → IP becomes free for another device  

**Purpose:** Ensures efficient use of IP addresses and avoids conflicts.  

---

## 6. DNS Server Address
- DHCP also provides the **DNS server address** to the device.  
- **Purpose:** Tells the device which DNS server to contact to resolve domain names to IPs.  
- Ensures automatic, consistent, and correct domain resolution across the network.  

---

## 7. Default Gateway
- DHCP provides the **default gateway address** (usually your router).  
- **Purpose:** Allows devices to communicate with networks outside the local network (like the Internet).  
- Acts as the **“exit door”** for traffic going to other networks.  

### Scenario Example
- Device IP = `192.168.1.15`  
- Subnet = `255.255.255.0` → local network = `192.168.1.0/24`  
- Default Gateway = `192.168.1.1` (router)  
- When visiting `www.google.com`:  
  1. Device sees Google is outside local network.  
  2. Sends packet to **default gateway `192.168.1.1`**.  
  3. Router forwards it to Internet and brings back the reply.

## 8. Real-Life Examples

- **Home Wi-Fi Router** → Acts as DHCP server for your phone, laptop, TV.  
- **Office Networks** → A central DHCP server manages thousands of devices.  
- **Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)** → When you launch a VM, the cloud provider uses DHCP internally to give it a private IP. 

## Summary
- DHCP = Automatically assigns **IP addresses** and network settings.  
- **DORA** = 4-step process (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge).  
- **Lease Time** = Duration of IP assignment; ensures recycling of IPs.  
- **DNS Server Address** = Tells device where to resolve domain names.  
- **Default Gateway** = Router IP to reach outside networks.
