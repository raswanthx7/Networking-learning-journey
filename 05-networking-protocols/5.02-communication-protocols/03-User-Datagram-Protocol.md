##  What is UDP?
**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** is a **connectionless transport layer protocol**.  

- It does **not establish a connection** before sending data.  
- It is **fast and lightweight**, but does **not guarantee delivery** or order of packets.  
- UDP is used when **speed is more important than 100% reliability**.

##  Features of UDP

1. **Connectionless**
   - No handshake is needed. Data packets are sent directly.  
   - Example: Free Fire game sends player movements without checking if the server is ready for every packet.

2. **Unreliable**
   - Lost packets are **not retransmitted**.  
   - Example: If a movement packet in Free Fire is lost during lag, the game ignores it and continues.

3. **No Ordered Delivery**
   - Packets can arrive out of order.  
   - Example: In YouTube Live streaming, some frames may arrive late or out of order → video still plays smoothly.

4. **Fast and Lightweight**
   - Ideal for real-time applications where **latency is critical**.  
   - Example: Online gaming or live streaming where delayed packets affect experience.  

    **Explanation:**  
   *"UDP is used in applications where low latency is critical. Latency means the delay between sending and receiving data. In online gaming like Free Fire or live streaming like YouTube Live, speed of delivery is more important than reliability. UDP sends packets immediately without waiting for acknowledgements or retransmissions, ensuring fast real-time communication."*

##  Real-Life Examples

- **Free Fire (Online Gaming)** → Player movements and actions are sent in real-time. Some packets can be lost, but speed is crucial.  
- **YouTube Live / Video Streaming** → Live frames are streamed fast. Small losses are acceptable to maintain real-time video flow.

##  UDP in Cloud/Companies
- Cloud services use UDP for **real-time streaming and gaming servers**.  
- **Gaming servers** like Free Fire rely on UDP to minimize lag for thousands of concurrent players.  
- **Live streaming platforms** like YouTube Live use UDP for low-latency video delivery.

##  Protocols that use UDP
Some application protocols rely on UDP due to speed requirement:  

- **DNS (Domain Name System)** → Quick request/response.  
- **VoIP / SIP** → Real-time communication (outside WhatsApp).  
- **Online Gaming** → Fast multiplayer interactions.  
- **Streaming protocols** → e.g., live video streaming platforms.

---

 **Summary**:  
UDP is a **fast, connectionless protocol** that sacrifices reliability and ordering for speed. It is ideal for **online gaming** (like Free Fire) and **live video streaming** (like YouTube Live) where **low latency is more important than guaranteed delivery**. Unlike TCP, UDP does not use handshake or retransmit lost packets.
