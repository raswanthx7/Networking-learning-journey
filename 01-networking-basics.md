##  What is Networking?

Networking refers to the **connection of two or more devices (computers, phones, servers, etc.)** to communicate and share data and resources.

###  Purpose:
- Share files, printers, and data
- Communicate through apps like WhatsApp, Email, Zoom
- Access the Internet or private services
- Connect to remote servers (SSH, FTP, VPN)

##  Real-World Examples

| Service      | Networking Role |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Wi-Fi**    | Connects local devices to the Internet (via LAN & WAN) |
| **Internet** | Global network to access websites and services |
| **WhatsApp** | Sends messages via Internet from one client to another |
| **SSH**      | Connects to remote servers securely (used by admins/devs) |

##  Client vs Server

| Client              | Server                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Requests data       | Responds with data       |
| Example: Browser    | Example: Web Server      |
| Example: Mobile app | Example: WhatsApp Server |


> When you visit `www.google.com`, your browser is the **client**, and Google’s server responds with the webpage.

##  Types of Networks

###  PAN – Personal Area Network
- Very small range (e.g., 10 meters)
- Used for connecting personal devices
- **Example:** Bluetooth between phone & earbuds

###  LAN – Local Area Network
- Small area like office or home
- High-speed communication
- **Example:** Wi-Fi network in a home

###  WAN – Wide Area Network
- Covers a large area (cities, countries)
- Slower than LAN, but broader reach
- **Example:** Internet Service Provider connections

###  Internet
- The largest WAN
- Public global network
- Allows access to cloud services, websites, APIs

###  Intranet
- Private internal network for an organization
- Not accessible to the public
- **Example:** Employee HR portal in a company

##  Key Points

- Networking = Devices + Communication + Data sharing
- Client requests, Server responds
- Know the difference between LAN, WAN, Intranet, Internet, PAN

## Commands / Concepts Practiced Today

- No terminal/network commands today  
- Focus was on **theory and foundational understanding**
