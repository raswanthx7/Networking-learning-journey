## 1. Introduction to Data Transmission
- Data transmission is the process of sending data between devices in a network.  
- Based on the **destination devices**, transmission can be classified as: **Unicast, Broadcast, Multicast**.

---

## 2. Unicast
- **Definition:** Data is sent from **one sender to one specific receiver**.  
- **ASCII Diagram:**

```ASCII
[Sender] ----> [Receiver]
```

- **Advantages:**  
  - Direct communication, efficient for single recipient.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Not efficient if sending same data to multiple devices (requires multiple unicast messages).  
- **Real-world Use:**  
  - Web browsing, email, file transfer between two computers.

## 3. Broadcast
- **Definition:** Data is sent from **one sender to all devices** in the network segment.  
- **ASCII Diagram:**
```text
           +---------+
           | Device1 |
           +---------+
           | Device2 |
           +---------+
           | Device3 |
           +---------+
[Sender] ----------->
```

- **Advantages:**  
  - Reaches all devices at once.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Can cause network congestion if overused.  
- **Real-world Use:**  
  - ARP requests, DHCP discovery in LANs.

## 4. Multicast
- **Definition:** Data is sent from **one sender to a specific group of devices**.  
- **ASCII Diagram:**

```text
           +---------+
           | Device1 |  <- Receives
           +---------+
           | Device2 |  <- Receives
           +---------+
           | Device3 |  <- Does NOT receive
           +---------+
[Sender] ----------->
```

- **Advantages:**  
  - Efficient for group communication.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Requires multicast-enabled network devices.  
- **Real-world Use:**  
  - Video conferencing, IPTV, live streaming to selected users.
