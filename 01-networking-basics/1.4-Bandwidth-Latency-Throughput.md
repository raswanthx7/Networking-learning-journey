## 1. Bandwidth
**Definition:**  
Bandwidth is the **maximum amount of data** that can be transmitted over a network in a given time. It represents the **network capacity**, not the actual speed you always get.

**Free Fire Example:**  
Your ISP, Arc Fiber, provides **100 Mbps** speed. This 100 Mbps is your **bandwidth** — the maximum network speed you can use while playing Free Fire or performing other online activities.

## 2. Latency
**Definition:**  
Latency is the **time delay** for data to travel from your device to the server and back. It is measured in **milliseconds (ms)**. Higher latency means slower response and delay in communication.

**Free Fire Example:**  
When playing Free Fire, if the game shows **MS 999+**, it indicates **high latency**. This means your actions take longer to reach the game server, causing delays, lag, or stuttering.

## 3. Throughput
**Definition:**  
Throughput is the **actual amount of data successfully transmitted** over the network in a given time. It is often less than the maximum bandwidth due to network conditions.

**Free Fire Example:**  
Even if your ISP provides **100 Mbps**, you may only receive **85–95 Mbps** while playing Free Fire. This real, usable speed is your **throughput**, which affects game performance and download/upload speed.

## 4. Summary Table

| Metric      | Definition                                       | Free Fire Example |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Bandwidth  | Maximum network capacity                         | ISP provides 100 Mbps |
| Latency    | Time delay for data to travel (ms)              | Game shows MS 999+ |
| Throughput | Actual data successfully transmitted per second | Actual speed received 85–95 Mbps |

---

**Key Points:**  
- Bandwidth = potential maximum network speed  
- Latency = delay for data travel  
- Throughput = real speed you get
