# Networking Topologies

## Introduction

### What is a Backbone?
- The main central cable in a network where all devices transmit data.

### What is a Terminator?
- A device placed at the ends of a backbone to absorb signals and prevent reflections.

### What is a Switch?
- A network device that connects devices and forwards data only to the destination device.

### What is a Hub?
- A simple device that connects multiple devices; forwards data to all connected devices.

### What is a Router?
- A device that connects multiple networks and directs data between them.

## What is Networking Topology?
- Network topology defines the **physical or logical arrangement of devices** in a network.  
- It determines how data flows, how devices are connected, and how faults affect the network.

## Types of Networking Topologies

### 1. Bus Topology
- **Definition:** All devices share a single central backbone cable.  

```ASCII
[Terminator]---[PC1]---[PC2]---[PC3]---[PC4]---[Terminator]
            Backbone Cable
```
Devices are connected to a single central cable (backbone).

- **Advantages:**  
  - Easy to implement and cost-effective.  
  - Requires less cable than other topologies.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Backbone failure stops entire network.  
  - Difficult to troubleshoot.  

- **Real-world Use:**  
  - Old Ethernet LANs (10Base2, 10Base5).

### 2. Star Topology
- **Definition:** All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.  

```ASCII
        [PC1]
          |
[PC2] -- [SWITCH] -- [PC3]
          |
        [PC4]
```
All devices connect to a central hub/switch.

- **Advantages:**  
  - Easy to manage and troubleshoot.  
  - One device failure does not affect the network.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Central hub/switch failure stops the network.  
  - More cabling than bus topology.  

- **Real-world Use:**  
  - Home networks, offices, modern LANs.  

---

### 3. Ring Topology
- **Definition:** Each device is connected to exactly two other devices, forming a circle.  

```ASCII
[PC1] -- [PC2] -- [PC3] -- [PC4] -- [PC1]
```
Devices connected in a circular loop.

- **Advantages:**  
  - Data flows in a predictable path, reducing collisions.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
  - One device failure can break the loop.  

- **Real-world Use:**  
  - Older token ring networks, some WANs.  

---

### 4. Mesh Topology
- **Definition:** Every device is connected to every other device.  

```ASCII
  [PC1]------[PC2]
     |\       /|
     | \     / |
     |  \   /  |
     |   \ /   |
   [PC3]------[PC4]
```
Every device connected to every other device.

- **Advantages:**  
  - Very reliable, high redundancy.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Expensive due to many cables.  
  - Complex to configure.  

- **Real-world Use:**  
  - Data centers, critical network backbones.  

---

### 5. Tree Topology
- **Definition:** Multiple star topologies connected via a backbone.  

```ASCII
         [Backbone]
             |
        ------------
        |          |
     [SW1]      [SW2]
     / | \      / | \
  [PC1][PC2] [PC3][PC4]
  ```
Combination of star topologies connected to a backbone.

- **Advantages:**  
  - Hierarchical and scalable.  
  - Easy to expand.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Backbone failure affects large parts of the network.  

- **Real-world Use:**  
  - Large organizations, school campuses.  

---

### 6. Hybrid Topology
- **Definition:** Combination of two or more topologies (e.g., Star + Ring).  

- **Advantages:**  
  - Flexible and scalable.  
  - Can leverage strengths of multiple topologies.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Expensive and complex to design.  

- **Real-world Use:**  
  - Enterprise networks, cloud data centers.
