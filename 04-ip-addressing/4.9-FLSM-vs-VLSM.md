## 1. Explanation of FLSM and VLSM  

### FLSM (Fixed Length Subnet Mask)  
- All subnets are the same size.  
- Simple to calculate and manage.  
- Wastes many IP addresses.  
- Mostly used in **older networks, labs, or small organizations**.  

### VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)  
- Subnets can have different sizes, depending on requirement.  
- Efficient IP address utilization.  
- Slightly complex to design, but saves a lot of addresses.  
- Used in **modern companies, ISPs, cloud, and enterprises**.

##  Real-Life Example – Bank Network (FLSM vs VLSM)

###  Scenario
A bank has **4 departments**:  
- HR (50 users)  
- Finance (25 users)  
- IT (10 users)  
- Security (5 users)  

They have been given a **Class C network: 192.168.1.0/24** (total 256 IPs).  

### 1. Using FLSM (Fixed Length Subnet Mask)  

 **Rule:** Every subnet must be of the same size, even if a department doesn’t need that many IPs.  

- Network: `192.168.1.0/24`  
- Divide equally → Each subnet gets **64 IPs (/26)**  

| Department | Subnet           | IP Range                   | Usable IPs |
|------------|------------------|----------------------------|------------|
| HR         | 192.168.1.0/26   | 192.168.1.1 – 192.168.1.62 | 62         |
| Finance    | 192.168.1.64/26  | 192.168.1.65 – 192.168.1.126 | 62       |
| IT         | 192.168.1.128/26 | 192.168.1.129 – 192.168.1.190 | 62      |
| Security   | 192.168.1.192/26 | 192.168.1.193 – 192.168.1.254 | 62      |

 **Problem: Huge wastage!**  
- HR only needs 50 → Given 62  
- Finance needs 25 → Given 62  
- IT needs 10 → Given 62  
- Security needs 5 → Given 62  

 **Total needed = 90 users**  
 **Allocated = 248 IPs**  
 **Wastage = 158 IPs**  

### 2. Using VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)  

 **Rule:** Allocate IPs based on actual need.  
(Start from largest requirement = HR with 50 users).  

| Department | Subnet           | IP Range                   | Usable IPs |
|------------|------------------|----------------------------|------------|
| HR         | 192.168.1.0/26   | 192.168.1.1 – 192.168.1.62 | 62         |
| Finance    | 192.168.1.64/27  | 192.168.1.65 – 192.168.1.94 | 30        |
| IT         | 192.168.1.96/28  | 192.168.1.97 – 192.168.1.110 | 14       |
| Security   | 192.168.1.112/29 | 192.168.1.113 – 192.168.1.118 | 6        |

 **Efficient Allocation:**  
- HR gets 62 (fits 50 users)  
- Finance gets 30 (fits 25 users)  
- IT gets 14 (fits 10 users)  
- Security gets 6 (fits 5 users)  

 **Total needed = 90 users**  
 **Allocated = 112 IPs**  
 **Wastage = only 22 IPs**  


- **FLSM** → Simpler, but wastes IP addresses.  
- **VLSM** → Slightly complex, but saves addresses and scales better.  

That’s why in **banks, IT companies, cloud providers, and ISPs**, **VLSM is the default choice**.  
FLSM might still be used in **training labs, schools, or small offices** where simplicity matters more than efficiency.

## 3. FLSM vs VLSM – Comparison Table  

| Feature | **FLSM (Fixed Length Subnet Mask)** | **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)** |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Subnet Size** | All subnets are the same size | Subnets can be different sizes |
| **IP Utilization** | Wastes IP addresses | Efficient use of IPs |
| **Complexity** | Very simple to manage | Slightly complex to plan |
| **Scalability** | Poor scalability | Highly scalable |
| **When Used** | Old networks, labs, small offices | Modern networks, ISPs, enterprises, cloud |
| **Management Cost** | “Cheaper” in effort (easy) | “Cheaper” in resources (saves IPs) |

## 4. Why Are 2 IPs Always Reserved in Each Subnet?  

In every subnet:  
1. **Network Address** – The first IP (used to identify the subnet).  
2. **Broadcast Address** – The last IP (used to reach all hosts in the subnet).  

 Formula:  
\[
\text{Usable IPs} = 2^n - 2
\]  
(where `n` = number of host bits).  

Example:  
- `/26` = 64 IPs → 62 usable  
- `/27` = 32 IPs → 30 usable  
- `/28` = 16 IPs → 14 usable  
- `/29` = 8 IPs → 6 usable

## 5. Real-World Usage of FLSM and VLSM  

- **FLSM**  
  - Found in training labs, schools, or older strict networks.  
  - Example: A university subnetting exercise, or government networks with fixed-size rules.  

- **VLSM**  
  - Standard in modern networking.  
  - Used by:  
    - **ISPs (Airtel, Jio, AT&T, Verizon)** → allocate customer IPs.  
    - **Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)** → design Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).  
    - **Enterprises (banks, IT companies, telecoms)** → department-wise IP allocation.  

 Today, almost all **companies and cloud providers** use **VLSM**.
