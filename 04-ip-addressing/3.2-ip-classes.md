# 3.2 IP Classes

## 1. Introduction
In IPv4 networking, **IP classes** are a way to categorize IP address ranges based on network size and purpose.  
This is part of the **classful addressing** system, which was widely used before **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**.

Even though modern networks mostly use CIDR, understanding IP classes is important for networking fundamentals.

## 2. IPv4 Classes Overview

| Class | First Octet Range | Default Subnet Mask | Number of Networks | Hosts per Network | Example IP | Usage |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| **A** | 1 – 126          | 255.0.0.0           | 128 (0 & 127 reserved) | ~16,777,214       | 10.0.0.1   | Very large networks |
| **B** | 128 – 191        | 255.255.0.0         | 16,384              | ~65,534           | 172.16.5.4 | Medium networks |
| **C** | 192 – 223        | 255.255.255.0       | 2,097,152           | 254               | 192.168.1.10 | Small networks |
| **D** | 224 – 239        | N/A                 | N/A                 | N/A               | 224.0.0.5  | Multicasting |
| **E** | 240 – 255        | N/A                 | N/A                 | N/A               | 250.1.1.1  | Research / Experimental |

## 3. Special Notes
- **127.x.x.x** is reserved for loopback (localhost).
- Class **A**, **B**, and **C** can have **private** and **public** addresses.
- Class **D** is used for multicast (one-to-many communication).
- Class **E** is reserved for experimental and research use.

## 4. Private IP Ranges

| Class | Range |
|-------|-------|
| **A** | 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 |
| **B** | 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 |
| **C** | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 |

## 5. Usable IP Range & Reserved Addresses
In each network, certain IPs are **reserved** and cannot be assigned to devices:

| Address Type          | Example (Class C: 192.168.1.x) | Purpose |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|---------|
| **Network Address**   | `192.168.1.0`                  | Identifies the network itself |
| **Gateway (Router)**  | `192.168.1.1`                  | Usually the first usable address; default gateway for devices |
| **Usable Host Range** | `192.168.1.2` – `192.168.1.254` | Assignable to devices (PCs, printers, servers, etc.) |
| **Broadcast Address** | `192.168.1.255`                | Sends data to all devices in the network; not usable by a single device |

**Key Notes:**
- `.255` (broadcast) is **reserved** — you cannot assign it to a device.
- `.0` (network address) is **reserved**.
- Usable range is normally **.1 to .254** in Class C.
- `.1` is common for routers, but some networks use `.254` instead.

## 6. Quick Identification
You can identify the IP class by looking at the **first octet**:
- **1 – 126** → Class A
- **128 – 191** → Class B
- **192 – 223** → Class C
- **224 – 239** → Class D
- **240 – 255** → Class E

```bash
ip a    # Show IP details
```
