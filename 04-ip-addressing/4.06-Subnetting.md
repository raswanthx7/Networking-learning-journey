###  What is Subnetting?
Subnetting is the process of dividing one large network into multiple smaller networks called **subnets**.  
This helps in efficient IP address usage, reduces broadcast traffic, improves security, and allows different teams or departments to work in their own isolated networks.

---

###  What is a Subnet Mask?
A **subnet mask** defines which part of an IP address belongs to the **network** and which part belongs to the **hosts** (devices).  

- Example:  
  - IP Address: `192.168.1.10`  
  - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0` (`/24`)  
  - Network Portion: `192.168.1`  
  - Host Portion: `.10`  

 Without subnet mask, the computer cannot tell where the **network** ends and the **host** begins.

---

###  How Subnet Mask Works
- Subnet mask uses **binary 1s** for the **network portion** and **binary 0s** for the **host portion**.  
- Example:  
  - `255.255.255.0` → `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`  
  - First 24 bits (1s) → Network  
  - Last 8 bits (0s) → Hosts  

---

###  CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
CIDR allows **flexible subnetting** by using `/x` notation, where `x` = number of **network bits**.  

- Example:  
  - `/16` → `255.255.0.0` → 65,534 hosts  
  - `/24` → `255.255.255.0` → 254 hosts  
  - `/26` → `255.255.255.192` → 62 hosts  

 Increasing the prefix (`/16 → /17 → /18…`) means:  
- More **subnets**  
- Fewer **hosts per subnet**

---

##  Key Terms
- **IP Address** = Network + Host portion.  
- **Subnet Mask** = Defines division of network & host bits.  
- **CIDR** = Shows subnet mask in `/x` form.  
- **Network Address** = First address in a subnet.  
- **Broadcast Address** = Last address in a subnet.  
- **Usable Host Range** = All IPs between network & broadcast.

---

##  Formula with scenario
- **Number of Subnets** = `2^(borrowed bits)`  
- **Hosts per Subnet** = `2^(remaining host bits) - 2`

### Scenario
- We have a **Class C network**:
`192.168.1.0`

- Class C → **24 network bits** + **8 host bits**
- Requirement: Need **5 subnets**, each with enough hosts.

### Step 1: Find Required Subnets
We need **at least 5 subnets**.

**Formula:**
Number of Subnets = 2^(borrowed bits)

- If we borrow 2 bits →  
  `2^2 = 4 subnets ❌ (not enough, need 5)`
- If we borrow 3 bits →  
  `2^3 = 8 subnets ✅ (enough for 5)`

✔ So we **borrow 3 bits**.

### Step 2: Find Hosts per Subnet
- Originally Class C = **8 host bits**
- Borrowed = **3 bits**
- Remaining = **8 - 3 = 5 host bits**

**Formula:**
Hosts per Subnet = 2^(remaining host bits) - 2

= 2^5 - 2
= 32 - 2
= 30 hosts per subnet

### Final Answer
- **Total Subnets** = `8`
- **Hosts per Subnet** = `30`

###  Subnet Breakdown
| Subnet No. | Network Address | First Host   | Last Host    | Broadcast Address |
|------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| 1          | 192.168.1.0    | 192.168.1.1  | 192.168.1.30 | 192.168.1.31     |
| 2          | 192.168.1.32   | 192.168.1.33 | 192.168.1.62 | 192.168.1.63     |
| 3          | 192.168.1.64   | 192.168.1.65 | 192.168.1.94 | 192.168.1.95     |
| 4          | 192.168.1.96   | 192.168.1.97 | 192.168.1.126| 192.168.1.127    |
| 5          | 192.168.1.128  | 192.168.1.129| 192.168.1.158| 192.168.1.159    |
| 6          | 192.168.1.160  | 192.168.1.161| 192.168.1.190| 192.168.1.191    |
| 7          | 192.168.1.192  | 192.168.1.193| 192.168.1.222| 192.168.1.223    |
| 8          | 192.168.1.224  | 192.168.1.225| 192.168.1.254| 192.168.1.255    |

##  Example (Company Scenario)
Imagine a company has **one network block**: `172.16.0.0/24`  
- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`  
- Total hosts available: 254  

The company wants **separate networks** for:  
1. **Developers Team**  
2. **HR Team**  

 Solution: Subnetting.  

If we use `/25` instead of `/24`:  
- New Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.128`  
- Hosts per subnet: 126  

Now we get:  
- Subnet 1 (Developers): `172.16.0.0 – 172.16.0.127`  
- Subnet 2 (HR): `172.16.0.128 – 172.16.0.255`  

 Both teams are isolated, no extra hardware needed, and IPs are used efficiently.

---

##  Real-World Use
- Splitting departments (HR, Developers, Finance, IT).  
- Reducing broadcast storms in LAN.  
- Designing cloud networks (AWS VPCs, Azure VNets, GCP VPCs).  
- Applying different firewall or routing policies per subnet.  

---

##  Summary
- **Subnetting** = Dividing a large network into smaller networks.  
- **Subnet Mask** = Defines network vs host portion.  
- **CIDR** = Flexible method to define subnet mask (`/8` → `/32`).  
- Subnetting improves **efficiency, security, and management** in both traditional networks and modern cloud setups.
