## 1. Introduction
In computer networking, IP addresses are used to identify devices on a network.  
They are divided into **Private IP addresses** (used within local networks) and **Public IP addresses** (used on the internet).  
Understanding the difference is essential before learning NAT.

## 2. Private IP Address
**Definition:**  
A Private IP address is used **inside a private network** (such as home, office, or data center) and cannot be accessed directly from the internet.

**Reserved IPv4 ranges for Private IPs:**
- `10.0.0.0` – `10.255.255.255`
- `172.16.0.0` – `172.31.255.255`
- `192.168.0.0` – `192.168.255.255`

**Key Points:**
- Free to use (no cost).
- Can be repeated in different networks.
- Provides additional security since it’s not directly exposed to the internet.

**Example:**  
`192.168.1.10` — often assigned to a laptop or phone by your home router.

**Real-world Usage:**
- Used for internal communication in offices.
- In cloud computing (AWS, Azure, GCP), used for communication between servers inside a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

## 3. Public IP Address
**Definition:**  
A Public IP address is assigned to a device to be **directly accessible over the internet**.  
It must be **globally unique**.

**Key Points:**
- Assigned by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or cloud provider.
- Required for websites, email servers, and devices that need to be reachable from anywhere.
- Can be IPv4 or IPv6.

**Example:**  
`142.250.183.14` — one of Google’s public IP addresses.

**Real-world Usage:**
- Hosting websites and applications.
- Cloud virtual machines that need internet access.

## 4. Comparison Table

| Feature           | Private IP           | Public IP              |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Accessibility     | Local network only   | Accessible from internet |
| Uniqueness        | Can repeat in different networks | Must be unique globally |
| Cost              | Free                 | Assigned by ISP, may cost |
| Security          | More secure (hidden from internet) | Directly exposed to internet |
| Example Range     | 192.168.x.x          | 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)   |

## 5. How They Work Together
When a device with a private IP accesses the internet:
1. The request goes to a router.
2. The router uses NAT (Network Address Translation) to convert the private IP into a public IP.
3. The public IP is used to communicate with external servers.

---

## 6. Summary
- Private IP → Used for communication inside a network.
- Public IP → Used for communication over the internet.
- NAT is used to translate between them.
