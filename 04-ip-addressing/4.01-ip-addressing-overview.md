## 2. Types of IP Addresses

### 2.1 IPv4

- Written as **four decimal numbers** separated by dots.
- Example: `192.168.1.1`
- Range: `0.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`

### 2.2 IPv6
- **128-bit** format
- Written in **hexadecimal**, separated by colons.
- Example: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
- Supports more devices due to a much larger address space.
