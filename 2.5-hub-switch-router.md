##  Topics Covered

- What is a **Hub**, **Switch**, and **Router**
- what is **gateway**
- Why we use each device
- How they work
- Key differences
- Real-world usage in a network setup

##  1. What is a Hub?

A **hub** is a basic networking device that connects multiple computers in a **Local Area Network (LAN)**. It operates at **OSI Layer 1 (Physical Layer)**.

###  Why We Use a Hub

- To **broadcast** data to all connected devices.
- To allow multiple devices to **communicate** within the same LAN.

###  How It Works

- When one device sends data, the hub **forwards that data to every other port**, regardless of the destination.
- No filtering or intelligent routing happens.

###  Limitations

- Not secure – data is broadcasted to all devices.
- Causes **network congestion**.
- Slower due to **collisions** (data clashing).

###  Real-World Example

Old office networks or lab setups used hubs before switches became affordable and faster.

##  2. What is a Switch?

A **switch** is a more intelligent networking device than a hub. It operates at **OSI Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**.

###  Why We Use a Switch

- To connect multiple devices in a **LAN** more efficiently.
- To send data only to the **intended device** using MAC addresses.

### How It Works

- Each switch maintains a **MAC address table**.
- When a device sends data, the switch **forwards the data only to the correct port** where the destination MAC is registered.
- Reduces traffic and improves performance.

###  Advantages

- Faster and more secure than hubs.
- No collisions (thanks to full-duplex communication).
- Supports VLANs in managed switches.

###  Real-World Example

Every modern office, company network, and cloud data center uses switches for internal communication.

##  What is a Gateway?

A **Gateway** is a **network node** or a **device** that acts as an **entry or exit point** between two different networks using **different protocols**.

You can think of a gateway as a **translator** or **interpreter** between two systems that don’t speak the same language.

---

###  Why is a Gateway Used?

- To **connect different networks**, like LAN to WAN.
- To **convert protocols** (e.g., from TCP/IP to ATM).
- Used when **network architecture is different**.

---

###  Real-world Example of a Gateway

- Your **Wi-Fi router** in a home or office acts as a **gateway** when it connects your LAN to the Internet.
- In large organizations, **specialized gateways** are used to connect **cloud networks, databases**, or **legacy systems**.

##  3. What is a Router?

A **router** is a network device that connects **different networks** together. It operates at **OSI Layer 3 (Network Layer)**.

###  Why We Use a Router

- To connect a **local network to the internet**.
- To route data between different **networks or subnets**.
- Provides **IP addressing, DHCP**, and **NAT** (Network Address Translation).

###  How It Works

- Routes data based on **IP addresses** (unlike switches which use MAC).
- Connects a local switch (and all devices behind it) to an **ISP** (Internet Service Provider).
- Can assign IP addresses via DHCP.
- Converts private IP to public IP using NAT.

### Real-World Example

Home Wi-Fi routers, office gateways, cloud VPC routers.

| OSI Layer     | Layer 1          | Layer 2                    | Layer 3                     |

 These three are the **core networking devices** used in any infrastructure – from small offices to cloud environments.
